Step 1: Define Fuzzy Sets
Input: Universe of discourse (X-axis) is defined as a set of values (e.g., 0 to 10 with small intervals).

Process:

Fuzzy Set A: Defined using a triangular membership function.

Fuzzy Set B: Defined using a trapezoidal membership function.

Step 2: Union (A ∪ B)
Input: Two fuzzy sets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Process:

For each element 
𝑥
x in the universe of discourse 
𝑋
X, calculate the maximum of the membership values from sets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Union
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
=
max
⁡
(
𝐴
(
𝑥
)
,
𝐵
(
𝑥
)
)
Union(A,B)=max(A(x),B(x)) for all 
𝑥
∈
𝑋
x∈X.

Output: A new fuzzy set representing the union of 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Step 3: Intersection (A ∩ B)
Input: Two fuzzy sets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Process:

For each element 
𝑥
x in the universe of discourse 
𝑋
X, calculate the minimum of the membership values from sets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Intersection
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
=
min
⁡
(
𝐴
(
𝑥
)
,
𝐵
(
𝑥
)
)
Intersection(A,B)=min(A(x),B(x)) for all 
𝑥
∈
𝑋
x∈X.

Output: A new fuzzy set representing the intersection of 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Step 4: Complement (¬A)
Input: A fuzzy set 
𝐴
A.

Process:

For each element 
𝑥
x in the universe of discourse 
𝑋
X, calculate the complement by subtracting the membership value from 1.

Complement
(
𝐴
)
=
1
−
𝐴
(
𝑥
)
Complement(A)=1−A(x) for all 
𝑥
∈
𝑋
x∈X.

Output: A new fuzzy set representing the complement of 
𝐴
A.

Step 5: De Morgan’s Law (¬(A ∩ B) = ¬A ∪ ¬B)
Input: Two fuzzy sets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Process:

Calculate the intersection of 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Take the complement of the intersection: 
¬
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
¬(A∩B).

Take the complement of both sets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, and then find their union: 
¬
𝐴
∪
¬
𝐵
¬A∪¬B.

Verify if the complement of the intersection is equal to the union of the complements. If they are equal, De Morgan's law holds true.

Output: A message indicating whether De Morgan's Law holds or not.
